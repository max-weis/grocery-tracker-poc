# Grocery Tracker POC

This is a proof of concept for a grocery tracker application. It is a simple web application that allows users to upload a image of a grocery list and then track the items in the list.

## Setup

Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python3 main.py
```

Start the frontend server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start dev
```
